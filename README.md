A super-beginner project for newbies in Salesforce LWC
This one is a simple Salesforce LWC project where I've made a lightning web component using HTML and Javascript.

Not only do you get a score, you can also edit and play with the questions from embedded code snippets. You can also add your own questions in the app by modifying the Js file.
